=====================
Compilation:
Our primary development platform is Linux. 
We recommend a so-called out of source build which can be achieved
by the following command sequence.

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ../
- make

The binaries will be placed in bin and the libraries in lib which
are both located in the top-level folder.
